developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. I could write an entire letter on LLMs
and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter. Let’s just
say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.
So, in closing, I’m optimistic that we’ll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger
position than when we entered it. There are several reasons for it and I’ve mentioned many of them above.
But, there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity. While we have a
consumer business that’s $434B in 2022, the vast majority of total market segment share in global retail
still resides in physical stores (roughly 80%). And, it’s a similar story for Global IT spending, where we have
AWS revenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrate
to the cloud. As these equations steadily flip—as we’re already seeing happen—we believe our leading customer
experiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in the
coming years. And, of course, this doesn’t include the other businesses and experiences we’re pursuing at
Amazon, all of which are still in their early days.
I strongly believe that our best days are in front of us, and I look forward to working with my teammates at
Amazon to make it so.
Sincerely,
Andy Jassy
President and Chief Executive Officer
Amazon.com, Inc.

today as it was in 1997.
